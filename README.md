# Microclimate-sequential-data-ML

This project was done as part of a Skoltech diplomate in sequencial data modeling, highly focused on the theoric background to understand mashine learning in time series and practical examples of how to code it. 

In this project we explore many of the named tools from autoregression up to RNN and GRU.

The dataset is the control data from a phytotron at Skoltech agrolab, including ambient temperature and relative humidity (measured and set points).
