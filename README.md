# Microclimate-sequential-data-ML

This project was done as part of a Skoltech diplomate in sequential data modelling. It was highly focused on the theoric background to understand machine learning in time series and practical examples of how to code it. 

In this project, we explore many of the named tools from autoregression up to RNN and GRU.

The dataset is the control data from a phytotron at Skoltech agro-lab, including ambient temperature and relative humidity (measured and set points).

Here you can find the data set and the code of the project. As an educational activity is highly recommended to run it and try to write similar code yourself.
